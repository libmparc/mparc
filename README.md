# MPARC

MPAR reimplemented in C instead of C++.

Archive format, but you can make it into a key value database store somehow.

The code I written may be banned in embedded systems and absolutely destroyed in projects where dynamic allocations are not allowed.

## Enough of the boring stuff

You just need libc for standard functions, but (the boehm garbage collector/dmalloc) can be used to debug memory issues.
